# # CreateDatabase---WebApp

This project was developed for the "Databases" course and aims to **design a model of a database** and **implement it**. Afterwards we should also **develop a simple Python application** for the database. This project is subdivided into two parts.

## Requirements:

- Python 3
- Pip 3 Package Manager
- sqlite3
- Flask
- Jinja Templates

### You can check if you already have this requirements by running:
- Python 3
```bash 
python3 --version
```
- Pip3: 
```bash 
pip3 --version
```
- Flask:
```bash 
flask --version
```
- sqlite3:
```bash 
sqlite3 --version
```

<br></br>

### If you need to install anything just run:
- Python 3 and Pip 3
```bash 
sudo apt-get install python3 python3-pip
```
- Flask: 
```bash 
pip3 install --user Flask
```
- sqlite3:
```bash 
sudo apt install sqlite3
```

**Note:** When you install Flask, Jinja is automatically installed.

## About the Project:

### Part 1 - Design the database:

In the first part of the project, we were expected to **design a database model** for a universe of our choice supported with real data, considering:
- the description of the universe in question and a corresponding **UML class diagram**;
- mapping the UML class model into a **relational model**;

**Worked develop:**
To accomplish this part, we started by doing intensive research on sites like Kaggle to find data that would allow us to carry out the project within the constraints defined in the project statement. To make this possible, we selected a dataset with the 'Disney' theme and completed it so that we could use it.

### Part 2 - Create the Database and an APP :
This part of the project is intended to **implement the database model** proposed in part 1 in an **SQLite database** populated with the data and the **development of a simple python app** of the interface for the database.

**Worked develop:**
We start by creating the SQLite database and then we create the application that allows us to search by character, by the director of the film... It also allows us to see the relationships between each table created in the database model and do different types of searches through data.

## About the repository:
In this repository we have two folders correspondent to the two parts:

üîµ **Part 1:**
- assignment_part_1.pdf ‚û°Ô∏è Description of what is requested for part 1 of the project;
- project_part_1.pdf ‚û°Ô∏è Resolution of part 1;
- Excels ‚û°Ô∏è Folder with the excels extracted from Kaggle;
- CSVs ‚û°Ô∏è Converted excels to CSVs;

üîµ **Part 2:**
- assignment_part_2.pdf ‚û°Ô∏è Description of what is requested for part 2 of the project;
- project_part_1.pdf ‚û°Ô∏è Resolution of part 1;
- project_part_2.pdf ‚û°Ô∏è Resolution of part 2;
- Disney.db ‚û°Ô∏è The database created in SQLiteStudio
- App:
	- static ‚û°Ô∏è Folder with css and an image that was used
	- templates ‚û°Ô∏è HTML files

<br></br>

## Database Configuration: 

Edit the `db.py` file regarding your DB configuration, modifying the `DB_FILE` parameters that indicate the database file. The SQLite file for DB must reside in the same folder as the `app.py` file.

Test access by running:
```bash 
python3 test_db_connection.py TABLE_NAME
```
If the DB access configuration is correct, the contents of the TABLE_NAME table should be listed, for example. the DB Disney Genre table:

```bash 
$ python3 test_db_connection.py Genre
connected <sqlite3.Connection object at 0x7f7a6d146120>
10 results ...

## Running Program:

Access the terminal and make sure it is in the 'APP' directory to access it.
Run the command:
```bash 
python3 server.py
```
The following code will be displayed:
```bash 
$ python3 server.py 
connected <sqlite3.Connection object at 0x7fbadc57de40>
